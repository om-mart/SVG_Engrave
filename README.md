# SVG_Generator
Created as a group project for my university's computer vision class. This project is a Python script using OpenCV to generate SVGs from image edges, ideal for creating custom stencils, stamps, or engraving designs for laser cutting. This script processes images to detect contours and edges, outputting them as precise SVG files ready for fabrication or artistic applications.
